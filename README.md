  ### Set as a custom new tab in you browser

  To have your browser to show this page when a new tab is opened you need to install Mi-q extension:

  - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
  - Vivaldi - [supports Chrome extensions](https://vivaldi.com/blog/chrome-web-store-extensions-in-vivaldi-browser), therefore just install [Mi-q Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
  - Opera - install [Chrome extensions](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions) and then install [Mi-q Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
  - Firefox - not supported, as a workaround you can use [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override) and set [https://mi-q-home.com](https://mi-q-home.com) as a custom new page
  - Safari - not supported

  ### Set as homepage in your browser

  Set [https://mi-q-home.com](https://mi-q-home.com) as the homepage or as the startup page in your browser.
